    <Description>SharpCheddar ðŸ§€
These days databases are a dime a dozen. Not only are they plenty, but many of them
have specialized uses. It's becoming more common to use different types of datatypes
for different projects, or sometimes even for different purposes in a single project. 

SharpCheddar lets you abstract out your data layer using a common interface, providing many benefits. Just like cheese, you can put SharpCheddar ðŸ§€ on anything!

- Working with the different database types feels uniform
- It allow for more flexibility, ever wish you could change the underlying data provider of a data type? With SharpCheddar it's a brie-ze!
- Simpler, easier to maintain data access layers!
- Quicker to adopt a multiple databases in a project! 
- Quicker ramp up - just define your models and your database's native config, and start ripping one!

A suite of .NetStandard and DotNetCore data repositories. Designed with TDD, bearing the SOLID principles in mind, and implemnting `async/await` patterns.</Description>
